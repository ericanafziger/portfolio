##### Website for Epicodus programming portfolio, October 14, 2016

### By Erica Nafziger

## Description

This website will host my Epicodus portfolio and resume. Visitors will begin at a very minimal home page, which gives my full name and the fact that this is a web programming portfolio. From there, users can navigate using the navbar at the top of the page. Other pages include: about, work, and resume.

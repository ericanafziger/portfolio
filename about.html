          <h1>About Erica</h1>
          <img src="img/profile.jpg" alt="photo of Erica Nafziger">
          <p>Hi! I'm Erica. I went to college in Virginia, but I grew up in the Pacific Northwest and now call Portland, Oregon home. I am currently a student at Epicodus where I plan to study front-end development.</p>
          <h3>Education</h3>
          <p>I graduated summa cum laude with a degree in Digital Media from Easter Mennonite University in Harrisonburg, VA. I primarily focused on illustration, design, film, and photography during my time there. My senior project focused on turing illustrations into a digital format for printing and display.</p>
          <h3>Work Experience</h3>
          <p>After graduation in 2014 I spent some time working in retail before become the Digital and Fine Arts teacher at Western Mennonite School in January of 2015. During my time there I was awarded a $500 grant from the West Salem Rotary to expand the art program. Daily tasks included:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Developing curriculum</li>
            <li>Classroom management</li>
            <li>Lesson planning</li>
            <li>Fostering creativity in students</li>
          </ul>
          <h3>Why programming?</h3>
          <p>In college I took an intro to web design class and found how much I enjoyed creating websites trhough html and css. Since then I have explored coding on my own through online coding sites and by developing my own website. Once I decided I didn't want to pursue teaching as a career and began looking into programming schools which brought me to Epicodus.</p>
          <h3>Other Interests</h3>
          <p>One of my other primary interests and passions is photography. I love telling a story through a single image or series of images and capturing people. While I am not at Epicodus I continue working on developing myself as a professional portrait photographer. I am also crazy about dogs (mine is named Duck). I am also a member of the Portland Rock Gym where I am currently trying to climb my first V6!
